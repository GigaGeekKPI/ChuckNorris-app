![alt text](chuck-norris.png "Chuck Norris")

Hi ! This application was made to learn ReactJS and practice using an API. But the truth is ...

---
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Run app -> https://gigageekkpi.github.io/ChuckNorris-app/

In the application you can get jokes from chucknorris.io. It's a free JSON API for hand curated Chuck Norris facts. [Read more](https://api.chucknorris.io/#!). You have:

* Ability to get a random joke
* Ability to get a random joke from categories
* Ability to get jokes by free text search

You can even mark joke you like and it will never disappear from your browser, so you can close and open list of your favourite jokes whenever you want. Of course if you don't chuck-norris it from local storage...
Have fun :)
